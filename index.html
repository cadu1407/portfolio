            <p class="biography-text"> Hello! My name is Carlos Eduardo Cardoso Barreiros. I am 18 years old and
                currently enrolled in the third semester of Computer Science at Anhembi Morumbi University. I completed
                my primary education in 2022 at Adventist College of Liberdade. I have always had a passion for
                computers and a natural aptitude for related subjects. Initially, I aspired to become a civil engineer
                due to my strong mathematical skills, but that field experienced a decline in the market. It was then
                that my father recommended this field to me, and in early 2022, I began delving into it, taking relevant
                courses and developing a strong affinity for the field. Presently, I have knowledge in Programming
                (back-end/front-end),
                Relational Database, UML, System Requiremets, Computer Networks, Information Security. I am also
                actively seeking
                to enhance my fluency in the English language and currently enrolled in an English course at CNA
                language school, where I am at an Advanced Level 1. Some of my skills include being focused, organized,
                a team player, having good interpersonal relationships, and possessing a strong aptitude
                for learning.</p>
